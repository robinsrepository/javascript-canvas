# Combined JavaScript Canvas Projects üñºÔ∏è

## Description
A combination of eight projects I created using the JavaScript Canvas element to create dynamic visuals.    
Some projects showcase visual effects, animations and interactive features like hover effects and a keyboard-controlled piano.  
I am most proud of the fact that I drew the snowflakes all by myself! Of course I only drew one and then multiplied it.  

## Features
In the first 3 I learned to draw objects with different Canvas API methods.  
The next 5 demonstrate fun animations and interactions:  
- Interactive hover effects that trigger animations on mouse over.  
- A piano that can be played using your keyboard.  
If you need some inspiration for a song, try this one:  


P  P  P   P  P  P  P  +  8  9  P

\-  \-  \-  \- \-  P  P  P  P  P  9  9  P  9   +

P  P  P   P  P  P  P  +  8  9  P

\-  \-  \-  \- \-  P  P  P P  +  +  -  9  8


## Remarks
In an effort to keep the code clean and easy to follow, I removed almost all of the detailed comments that I originally wrote for myself.  
These comments helped me track my thought process and understand the purpose of each part of the code.  
However, I‚Äôve chosen not to include all of them in this project to avoid clutter.  
I hope this approach makes the code more accessible for general use.  
If you prefer to view the original version of the code with all my personal annotations,
