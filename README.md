# My JavaScript Canvas Projects üñºÔ∏è

## Description
A combination of eight projects I made using JavaScript and the canvas element to create dynamic visuals.    
Some projects showcase visual effects, animations and interactive features, like hover effects and a keyboard-controlled piano.  
At the end of these tutorials, I was able to add some things myself by applying what I've learned, like the snowflakes for example!  

## Features
In the first 3 projects, I learned how to draw objects with different canvas API methods.  
The next 5 projects demonstrate fun animations and interactions:  
- Interactive hover effects that trigger animations on mouseover.  
- A piano that can be played using your keyboard.  

## Remarks
To keep the code clean and easy to read, I removed almost all of the notes that I wrote for myself in this version.  
If you prefer to view the original code versions with all my notes, feel free to check them out in [this repository](https://github.com/robinsrepository/individual-canvas-projects).  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Enjoy exploring the different Canvas projects!

Here's a song you can play to try out the piano feature:

  P  P  P   P  P  P  P  +  8  9  P

  \-  \-  \-  \- \-  P  P  P  P  P  9  9  P  9   +

  P  P  P   P  P  P  P  +  8  9  P

  \-  \-  \-  \- \-  P  P  P P  +  +  -  9  8
